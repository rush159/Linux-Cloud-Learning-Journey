# 📂 Topics Covered

# 📄 File Extensions in Linux

- Linux doesn't depend on file extensions like `.txt`, `.jpg`, or `.mp4`.
- It reads the **file header (content)** to determine the file type.
- You can rename a `.txt` to `.mp4` and Linux will still treat it as a text file if the content matches.

# 📄 Creating Files & Folders

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `touch file.txt` | Create a single file |
| `touch file1 file2 file3` | Create multiple files |
| `mkdir foldername` | Create one folder |
| `mkdir a b c` | Create multiple folders |
| `mkdir -p a/b/c` | Create nested folders recursively |

---

# 🧹 Deleting Files & Folders

| Command | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `rm file.txt` | Delete a file |
| `rm -r folder/` | Delete folder and all contents |

# 🌟 Wildcards

| Wildcard | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `*` | Matches any characters | `ls *.txt` → all `.txt` files |

| `[]` | Matches a range or list | `ls file[1-3].txt` → `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, `file3.txt` |

---

# 🔧 Brace Expansion

| Command | Result |
|---------|--------|
| `touch file{1,2,3}.txt` | file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt |
| `mkdir week{1..3}` | week1 week2 week3 |
| `mkdir project{A,B}/day{1,2}` | projectA/day1 projectA/day2 projectB/day1 projectB/day2 |

```bash
# Create bin folder in home directory
mkdir ~/bin

# Move bash scripts to bin folder
mv script.sh ~/bin/
```

## 🏷️ Removing .sh Extension
```bash
# Rename scripts to remove .sh extension
mv backup.sh backup
mv create_folders.sh create_folders
```

## 🔒 Making Scripts Executable

### Method 1: GUI Interface

1. **Freedom 0**: Run the program for any purpose
2. **Freedom 1**: Study and modify the source code  
3. **Freedom 2**: Redistribute copies to help others
4. **Freedom 3**: Distribute your modified versions

These four pillars form the foundation of free software philosophy.

# 🖥️ GNU/Linux History
## 👨‍💻 Key Figures
- **Richard Stallman**: Founded GNU Project (1983)
- **Linus Torvalds**: Created Linux kernel (1991)
- **GNU/Linux**: Combination completed around 1992-1993

## 🧩 The Missing Piece
- GNU Project provided most system utilities
- Linus Torvalds created the missing kernel
- Together they formed complete GNU/Linux operating system

---
# 🛠️ GNU Core Utilities Exploration
## 🌐 Source Discovery
- Visited **gnu.org** website
- Navigated to downloads section
- Found **coreutils** package containing:
  - `ls` command
  - `date` command  
  - `echo` command
  - Many other essential utilities

## 📦 Source Code Download
```bash
# Downloaded latest coreutils source
# File format: coreutils-x.x.tar.xz
# Extension: .xz (requires -J flag for extraction)
```

---
# 🔧 Source Code Compilation Process
## 📂 Extraction & Exploration
```bash
# Extract source code (capital J for .xz files)
tar -xJf coreutils-x.x.tar.xz

# Navigate into source directory
cd coreutils-x.x

# Find ls command source using grep
grep -r "ls" src/
```

## ✏️ Source Code Modification
- Located `ls.c` file in source directory
- Edited using `nano` editor
- Found `main()` function
- Added custom line: "hello master" message
- All GNU utilities written in **C language**

---
# ⚙️ Build Environment Setup
## 🔨 Installing Required Tools
```bash
# Install GNU C Compiler
sudo apt-get install gcc

# Install make command
sudo apt-get install make
```

## 🏗️ Configuration Process
```bash
# Configure build for system architecture
./configure
```
- Detects hardware architecture (32-bit/64-bit)
- Creates various build files:
  - `Makefile.in`
  - `Makefile` (no extension)
  - `Makefile.am`

---
# 🚀 Compilation & Installation
## 📝 Build Process
```bash
# Compile modified source code
make
```
- Compiles only changed/updated C files
- Converts C code to machine code
- Incremental compilation (only rebuilds what changed)

## 💾 System Installation
```bash
# Install compiled software system-wide
sudo make install
```
- Installs new binaries to system directories
- Makes custom modifications available globally

---
# 🔄 Build System Understanding
## 📊 Compilation Workflow
| Step | Command | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Configure** | `./configure` | System detection & Makefile generation |
| **Compile** | `make` | Convert C source to machine code |
| **Install** | `sudo make install` | Deploy binaries system-wide |

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- **GCC**: GNU Compiler Collection (compiles C code)
- **Make**: Build automation tool
- **Machine Code**: Binary code computers understand
- **Incremental Build**: Only recompiles changed files

---
# 🎯 Archive Formats
## 📁 Compression Types
- **`.tar.xz`**: Use `tar -xJf` (capital J)
- **`.tar.bz2`**: Use `tar -xjf` (lowercase j)
- **`.tar.gz`**: Use `tar -xzf` (lowercase z)

---
# 💡 Restoration Process
## 🔙 Reverting Changes
```bash
# Edit ls.c back to original state
nano src/ls.c

# Recompile and reinstall
make
sudo make install
```

---

# 📚 Software Repositories Overview
## 🏛️ What are Software Repositories?
- **Software repositories** = Digital libraries for software packages
- Just like libraries have books, repositories have categorized software
- Central storage locations where software packages are maintained and distributed

## 🔍 System Information Discovery
### Finding Your Ubuntu Version
```bash
# Check Ubuntu version and system details
lsb_release -a

# Check hardware architecture
uname -m
```
**My System:**
- **Ubuntu Version**: Noble 24.04 LTS
- **Architecture**: AMD64

---
# 🗂️ Ubuntu Repository Types
## 📦 Four Main Software Repositories
| Repository | Management | Description |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| **Main** | Canonical Team | Official Ubuntu-supported packages |
| **Universe** | Community | Open source, community-maintained packages |
| **Restricted** | Canonical | Proprietary drivers for hardware compatibility |
| **Multiverse** | Community | Software with licensing restrictions |

## 🌐 Repository Exploration
- **Website**: `packages.ubuntu.com`
- **Package Categories**: Video, Audio, Music, Text, Development, etc.
- **Architecture Support**: Packages available for different hardware architectures

---
# 🔗 Package Dependencies System
## 🧩 Four Types of Dependencies
1. **Depends**: Required packages (must have)
2. **Recommends**: Strongly suggested packages
3. **Suggests**: Optional but useful packages  
4. **Enhances**: Packages that improve functionality

## ⚙️ The Complexity Problem
- Each software has multiple versions for different architectures
- Manual dependency resolution is extremely tedious
- Managing compatibility between packages is complex

---
# 🛠️ APT Package Manager
## 📋 What is APT?
- **APT** = Advanced Package Tool
- Ubuntu's built-in package manager
- **Automatic handling of**:
  - Hardware architecture detection
  - Dependency resolution
  - Version compatibility
  - Installation/removal processes

## 🔍 APT Search Commands
### Finding Software Packages
```bash
# Search for software related to Microsoft Word (docx files)
apt-cache search docx

# Narrow down to text-related software only
apt-cache search docx | grep text
```

### Getting Detailed Package Information
```bash
# Show comprehensive package details
apt-cache show [package-name]
```

**Information Provided:**
- Software version
- Creator/maintainer details
- Contact information
- Detailed description
- Dependencies list
- Package size and installation requirements

---
# 💾 Offline Package Discovery
## 🗃️ Local APT Cache
- APT maintains local cache from Ubuntu ISO file
- **Offline capability**: Search packages without internet connection
- Cache contains essential package metadata
- Enables package discovery even in offline environments

---
# 🎯 Key Learning Points
