# Linux-Cloud-Learning-Journey

## About

This repository documents my daily learning progress as I build my skills for Cloud Administration and Computing roles.

## Day 1 - June 23, 2025

- Started my Linux journey:  
  - Installed VirtualBox and Ubuntu VM  
  - Adjusted BIOS and Windows settings to enable virtualization  
- Learned terminal shortcuts:  
  - Clear command line, open/close terminal
- Practiced basic Linux commands:  
  - `date`, `echo`, `cal`, `history`  
  - Explored adding options and inputs to these commands
- Learned how to check the path of commands using `$PATH` and understood its purpose
- Learned core Linux concepts:  
  - Terminal, Shell, Commands, and how they interact together
- Explored command options:  
  - `-A`, `-B`, combined short options, long options using `--`
- Learned about the Linux Manual (`man` command):  
  - How to access, navigate, and interpret manuals
  - Understood key notations:  
    - `[]` = optional  
    - `<>` = required  
    - `|` = choose between options

# Upcoming Topics
 -Standard Input ,Outputs and Errors
 -Redirection basics and advanced
 -sort, grep, cut commands

## Day 2 - June 24, 2025

  Day 2 - June 24, 2025
    Learned about Linux input/output system:
        Standard Input (stdin) â€“ user input from keyboard
        Standard Output (stdout) â€“ regular command output
        Standard Error (stderr) â€“ error messages
        Understood how these are displayed and handled in the terminal

   Practiced file redirection:
        > to overwrite output into a file
        >> to append output to an existing file
        < to use a file as input
        Created multiple files and redirected output using these operators
    Learned and practiced:
        cat â€” creating, viewing, and combining file contents
        cut â€” extracting fields using delimiters (-d, -f options)
        sort â€” sorting file content alphabetically or numerically
        Started using piping (|) to chain multiple commands together
    Practiced with AI-assisted problem sets on redirection and piping:
        Asked ChatGPT to generate command-line problems
        Solved scenarios involving multiple redirections and file manipulations
    Started exploring command-line filtering:
        Learned basics of grep (more practice planned for Day 3)
Upcoming Topics
    Deep dive into grep, awk, and sed
    Chaining commands with advanced piping
    Creating bash scripts for automation
    Practicing real-world mini tasks using Linux CLI
This repository will be updated daily as I continue progressing toward cloud/system admin roles. ðŸŒ±ðŸ’»
