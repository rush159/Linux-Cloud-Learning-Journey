# 📂 Topics Covered

# 📄 File Extensions in Linux

- Linux doesn't depend on file extensions like `.txt`, `.jpg`, or `.mp4`.
- It reads the **file header (content)** to determine the file type.
- You can rename a `.txt` to `.mp4` and Linux will still treat it as a text file if the content matches.

---

# 📄 Creating Files & Folders

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `touch file.txt` | Create a single file |
| `touch file1 file2 file3` | Create multiple files |
| `mkdir foldername` | Create one folder |
| `mkdir a b c` | Create multiple folders |
| `mkdir -p a/b/c` | Create nested folders recursively |

---

# 🧹 Deleting Files & Folders

| Command | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `rm file.txt` | Delete a file |
| `rm -r folder/` | Delete folder and all contents |
| `rmdir folder/` | Delete only empty folder |

> ⚠️ Warning: `rm -r` is powerful — use it carefully.

# 🌟 Wildcards

| Wildcard | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `*` | Matches any characters | `ls *.txt` → all `.txt` files |
| `?` | Matches one character | `ls f?.txt` → `f1.txt`, `fa.txt` |
| `[]` | Matches a range or list | `ls file[1-3].txt` → `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, `file3.txt` |

---

# 🔧 Brace Expansion

| Command | Result |
|---------|--------|
| `touch file{1,2,3}.txt` | file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt |
| `mkdir week{1..3}` | week1 week2 week3 |
| `mkdir project{A,B}/day{1,2}` | projectA/day1 projectA/day2 projectB/day1 projectB/day2 |

---

# 🔧 Making Scripts Executable & Global

## 📂 Setting Up Personal bin Directory
```bash
# Create bin folder in home directory
mkdir ~/bin

# Move bash scripts to bin folder
mv script.sh ~/bin/
```

## 🏷️ Removing .sh Extension
```bash
# Rename scripts to remove .sh extension
mv backup.sh backup
mv create_folders.sh create_folders
```

## 🔒 Making Scripts Executable

### Method 1: GUI Interface
1. Navigate to bin folder in file manager
2. Right-click on script file
3. Properties → Permissions → Make executable

### Method 2: chmod Command
```bash
chmod +x filename
```
- `chmod` = Change mode
- `+x` = Add execute permission
- Makes script executable from command line
